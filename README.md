Please see my featured projects:

## [Project 1: Endangered Animal Database Construction and Analysis](https://github.com/thclough/endangered_db)
* Designed a database to integrate various data sources on endangered species trade
* Wrangled big, messy data on trades for the purpose of database compatibility and easier analysis
* Wrote queries on the database (used CTE's, staging tables, joins, window functions, etc.) and created visualizations
* Created an [interactive animated graph app](https://clough-tighe-hastings-cites-dash.onrender.com) giving an overview of the data and deployed on render (I have the free version of render so you may need to give it a few minutes to load, if you have the patience that is ;))
* Theorized use cases and performed appropriate analysis

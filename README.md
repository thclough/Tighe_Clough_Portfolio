## [Project 1: Stochastic Matrix Calculator](https://github.com/thclough/stochastic_matrix_calculator) 
#### in collaboration with [Alton Banushi](https://github.com/banushi-a)
* Automate common calculations and classfications for a given right stochastic matrix (see readme for list of calculations)
* Implemented pared-down Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components Algorithm to test if a stochastic matrix is ergodic
* Created short calculation that uses eigenvectors to produce the equilibrium distribution(s) of a stochastic matrix
* REPL user-interface for calculations

## [Project 2: Wartime Presidents Inaugural Addresses: NLP Analysis](https://github.com/thclough/inaugural_address_analysis)
* Processed text from selected inaugural addresses
* Generated word clouds for each speech
* Visualized sentiment scores for comparison among speeches
* Create Sankey diagram to show common usage of non-trivial words

## [Project 3: Challenger Incident Analysis](https://github.com/thclough/challenger_incident_analysis)
* Calculated inverse distance-weighted temperatures from weather station data to investigate the *Challenger* Shuttle Disaster
* Visualized temperatures across the United States on a given day using numpy array meshgrids and overlaying on a US map
* Integrated visualizations into a story of the incident

## ~~[Project 4: Endangered Animal Database Construction and Analysis](https://github.com/thclough/endangered_db)~~ (Currently Updating)
* Designed a database to integrate various data sources on endangered species trade
* Wrangled big, messy data on trades for the purpose of database compatibility and easier analysis
* Wrote queries on the database (used CTE's, staging tables, joins, window functions, etc.) and created visualizations
* Created an [interactive animated graph app](https://clough-tighe-hastings-cites-dash.onrender.com) giving an overview of the data and deployed on render (I have the free version of render so you may need to give it a few minutes to load, if you have the patience that is ;))
* Theorized use cases and performed appropriate analysis

Preview of app:
